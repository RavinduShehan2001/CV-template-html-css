# CV-template-html-css

A basic CV template using HTML and CSS is a simple webpage that is structured to display information about a job candidate's education, skills, and work experience. The template will typically include the following sections:

Header: This section will typically include the candidate's name and contact information, such as their phone number and email address.

Summary: This section will provide a brief overview of the candidate's qualifications and experience.

Education: This section will list the candidate's educational background, including the name of the institutions they attended, the degrees they earned, and the dates of attendance.

Skills: This section will list the candidate's technical skills and relevant software knowledge

Experience: This section will list the candidate's work experience, including the names of the companies they worked for, the dates of employment, and the duties they performed.

Reference: This section will list the contact information of any professional references the candidate has.

The template will be built using HTML for the structure and CSS for the styling. HTML will be used to create the different sections and elements of the template, such as headings, paragraphs, and lists. CSS will be used to add styling to the template, such as colors, fonts, and layouts.

It will be a responsive template that adapts itself according to the device it's being viewed on.
